# generate a word at random and store it in a variable
# display the length of the word to the user
# correct_guesses is less than the length of the word
# prompt the user to guess a letter
# if the guess is incorrect increment incorrect_guesses by 1 
# if the incorrect_guesses is greater than 13, tell the user 
# they lost and exit the program
# if correct_guesses is equal to the length of the word, tell the user they won
